Step 1- Data Preprocessing: The data set requires significant cleaning and preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.


Step 2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I have explored the dataset to understand the relationships between variables. Various visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the data.


Step 3- Model Implementation: I have implemented with all these models Ridge Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. Apply to tune the parameters for optimal performance.

Step 4- Model Evaluation: I have evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing data. And calculate appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


Step 5- Cross Validation and Overfitting Check: Check if overfitting exists and  perform 10-fold cross validation. This process ensures the model's robustness and its ability to generalize well to unseen data
